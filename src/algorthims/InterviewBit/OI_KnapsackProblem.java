	/**
	 * Given two integer arrays A and B of size N each which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively.
	 *
	 * Also given an integer C which represents knapsack capacity.
	 *
	 * Find out the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.
	 *
	 * NOTE:
	 *
	 * You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
	 *
	 *
	 * Problem Constraints
	 * 1 <= N <= 103
	 *
	 * 1 <= C <= 103
	 *
	 * 1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 103
	 *
	 *
	 *
	 * Input Format
	 * First argument is an integer array A of size N denoting the values on N items.
	 *
	 * Second argument is an integer array B of size N denoting the weights on N items.
	 *
	 * Third argument is an integer C denoting the knapsack capacity.
	 *
	 *
	 *
	 * Output Format
	 * Return a single integer denoting the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.
	 *
	 *
	 *
	 * Example Input
	 * Input 1:
	 *
	 *  A = [60, 100, 120]
	 *  B = [10, 20, 30]
	 *  C = 50
	 * Input 2:
	 *
	 *  A = [10, 20, 30, 40]
	 *  B = [12, 13, 15, 19]
	 *  C = 10
	 *
	 *
	 * Example Output
	 * Output 1:
	 *
	 *  220
	 * Output 2:
	 *
	 *  0
	 *
	 *
	 * Example Explanation
	 * Explanation 1:
	 *
	 *  Taking items with weight 20 and 30 will give us the maximum value i.e 100 + 120 = 220
	 * Explanation 2:
	 *
	 *  Knapsack capacity is 10 but each item has weight greater than 10 so no items can be cons
